= ops - a script based system configuration/management toolkit

== Scope

The goal of ops is to make it easy to organize scripts.

== Design

Each directory is an object (in the prototype based object oriented
programming sense of the term). Each executable is a method and each
non-executable file is a property.

Call a method on an object via

----
ops <object>.<method>
----

Inside a method call other methods via call:

----
call <object>.<method>
----

or on the object:

----
call this.<method>
----

get a property via prop:

----
prop this.<member>
----

get a property's filename with the -f flag:

----
prop this.<member> -f
----
