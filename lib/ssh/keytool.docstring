ssh.keytool [ -n ] FILENAME [ comment | key | email | name ]

Extracts either the comment, key, email or name (these later two
assuming the comment is a properly formated email) from an ssh key.

If FILENAME is "-" reads the key (as a single line) from stdin.

If the -n argument is present the trailing newline in the output will
be suppressed.
